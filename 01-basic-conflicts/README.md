# Basic Merge Conflicts

This section contains **isolated, hands-on exercises** that demonstrate
the most common types of Git merge conflicts.

Each folder is **one self-contained lab**.

## Prerequisites

You should already understand:
- Commit graphs
- Branches
- Three-way merge
- Index vs working tree

(covered in `00-git-mental-models/`)

## How to Use This Section

For each exercise:
1. Follow commands **exactly in order**
2. Predict whether a conflict will occur
3. Run the merge
4. Inspect the result
5. Read the takeaway

If something breaks, reset your repo before continuing.
